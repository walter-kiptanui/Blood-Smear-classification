Machine learning has revolutionized how diseases can be diagnosed. with the presence of adequate data machine learning can be leveraged in the health sector for diagnois.
In this project, our task was to create a model that classifies blood sample images as either infected with malaria or not.
The dataset was obtained under the Tensorflow Image libraries. 
In the project, three deep learning models were used: VGG19, Custom Convolution Neural Network, and ResNet50 after which the comparison of the performance of the models was done in order to get the best model.
